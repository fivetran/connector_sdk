"""This connector demonstrates keyset pagination for incremental syncs using the Fivetran Connector SDK.
It uses a cursor (e.g., updatedAt timestamp) to fetch new/updated records since the last sync.
This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the fivetran-api-playground package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.
See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/technical-reference/connector-sdk-code/connector-sdk-methods#update)
